    "If we wanted to optimize our chances of surviving a bear encounter, we could construct a decision tree to tell us what action to take.As our dataset gets larger though, this gets less and less practical. What if we had 10000 rows and 10 variables? Would you want to look through all the possibilities to construct a tree?\n",

    "This is where the decision tree machine learning algorithm can help. It enables us to automatically construct a decision tree to tell us what outcomes we should predict in certain situations.\n",

    "The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't.\n",

    "We're computing information gain (IG) for a given target variable (T), and a given variable that we want to split based on (A).  To compute this, we first calculate the entropy for T. Then, for each unique value v in the variable A, we compute the number of rows in which A takes on the value v, and divide it by the total number of rows. We then multiply this by the entropy of the rows where A is v. We add together all of these subset entropies, and subtract from the overall entropy to get information gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an even simpler explanation, we're finding the entropy of each set post-split, weighting it by the number of items in each split, then subtracting from the current entropy. If it's positive, we've lowered entropy with our split. The higher it is, the more we've lowered entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy to construct trees to is to create as many branches at each node as there are unique values for the variable being split on. So if the variable has 3 or 4 values, that would result in 3 or 4 branches. Usually, this is more complexity than it's worth, and doesn't improve prediction accuracy, but it's worth knowing about.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of information gain, and to make splits simpler, we won't do it for each unique value. Instead, for the variable we're splitting on, we'll find the median. Any rows where the value of the variable is below the median will split left, and the rest of the rows will split right. To compute information gain, we'll only have to compute entropies for two subsets.例示\n",
