    "Decision trees are a powerful and commonly used machine learning technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to optimize our chances of surviving a bear encounter, we could construct a decision tree to tell us what action to take.As our dataset gets larger though, this gets less and less practical. What if we had 10000 rows and 10 variables? Would you want to look through all the possibilities to construct a tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the decision tree machine learning algorithm can help. It enables us to automatically construct a decision tree to tell us what outcomes we should predict in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't.\n",

    "Trees can be used for classification or regression problems."
