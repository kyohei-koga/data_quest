    "Typically, researchers will use 5% as a significance threshold -- if an event would only happen 5% or less of the time by random chance, then it is statistically significant. If an event would happen more than 5% of the time by random chance, then it isn't statistically significant.\n",
    "In our case, there is 12% chance that the weather would be sunny 8 days out of 10 by random chance. We add this to 4% for 9 days out of 10, and .6% for 10 days out of 10 to get a 16.6% total chance of the sunny outcome happening 8 or more time in our 10 days. Our result isn't statistically significant, so we'd have to go back to the lab and spend some time adding more flux capacitors to our weather control device."
