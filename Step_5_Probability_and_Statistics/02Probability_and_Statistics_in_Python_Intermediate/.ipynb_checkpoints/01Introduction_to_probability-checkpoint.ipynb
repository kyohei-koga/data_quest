The probability of getting the first blue candy is 5/10, or 1/2. When we pick a blue candy, though, we remove it from the bag, so the probability of getting another is 4/9. The probability of picking a third blue candy is 3/8. This means our final probability is 1/2 * 4/9 * 3/8, or .0833. So, there is an 8.3% chance of picking three blue candies in a row."
